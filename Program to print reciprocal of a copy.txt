Given a string S, we need to find reciprocal of it. The reciprocal of the letter is found is
found by finding the difference between the position of the letter and the first letter 'A'
.Then decreasing the same number of steps from the last letter 'Z' .The character that we 
reach after steps is reciprocal.
Reciprocal of Z is A and vice versa because if you reverse if you 
reverse the position of the alphabet A 
will be in the position of Z.
Similarly, if the letters is a small case then the first will be 'a' and the last letter
will be 'a'and the last letter will be 'z'. and the 
definition of the reciprocal remains the same.

NOTE - IF THE CHARACTER IS NOT A LETTER ITS RECIPROCAL WILL BE THE SAME CHARACTER .
